# bioinformatics algorithms code challenges	
  all the codes are self_written inspired by problem sets and algorithms from http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org	
  txt files are the raw data to be processed
  some alternate solutions posted by other learners online are incorporated and annotated 
  all the codes have passed the tests from the coursera specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics
