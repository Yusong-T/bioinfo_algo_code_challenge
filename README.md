# bioinformatics algorithms code challenges	
  All the codes are self-written inspired by problem sets and algorithms from http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.org.
  txt files are the raw data to be processed.
  Some alternate solutions posted by other learners online are incorporated and annotated.
  All the codes have passed the tests from the Coursera specialization: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics.
